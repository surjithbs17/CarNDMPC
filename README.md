## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./mpc`.

## Tips

1. It's recommended to test the MPC on basic examples to see if your implementation behaves as desired. One possible example
is the vehicle starting offset of a straight line (reference). If the MPC implementation is correct, after some number of timesteps
(not too many) it should find and track the reference line.
2. The `lake_track_waypoints.csv` file has the waypoints of the lake track. You could use this to fit polynomials and points and see of how well your model tracks curve. NOTE: This file might be not completely in sync with the simulator so your solution should NOT depend on it.
3. For visualization this C++ [matplotlib wrapper](https://github.com/lava/matplotlib-cpp) could be helpful.)
4.  Tips for setting up your environment are available [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)
5. **VM Latency:** Some students have reported differences in behavior using VM's ostensibly a result of latency.  Please let us know if issues arise as a result of a VM environment.

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/b1ff3be0-c904-438e-aad3-2b5379f0e0c3/concepts/1a2255a0-e23c-44cf-8d41-39b8a3c8264a)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./

## The model

The Model Predictive Controller (MPC) calculates the trajectory, actuations and sends back steering to the simulator. 
The state vector of the vehicle is given as:

```
x - Vehicle position in forward direction
y - Vehicle position in lateral direction
psi - Angle of the vehicle (yaw angle)
v - Vehicle's speed
cte - cross-track error
epsi - orientation error

The actuators are:
delta - Steering angle (radians)
a - acceleration

Lf - the distance between the center of mass of the vehicle and the front wheels.

```

The model is expressed as following:

```
x_[t+1] = x[t] + v[t] * cos(psi[t]) * dt
y_[t+1] = y[t] + v[t] * sin(psi[t]) * dt
psi_[t+1] = psi[t] + v[t] * delta[t] / Lf * dt
v_[t+1] = v[t] + a[t] * dt
cte[t+1] = f(x[t]) - y[t] + v[t] * sin(epsi[t]) * dt
epsi[t+1] = psi[t] - psides[t] + v[t] * delta[t] / Lf * dt

```

## Convert Map coordinate to Car coordinate

```
dx = ptsx[i] - px;
dy = ptsy[i] - py;
x_car = dx * cos(psi) + dy * sin(psi);
y_car = -dx * sin(psi) + dy * cos(psi);

```

## Model Predictive Control with Latency

The state values are calculated using the model and the delay interval to handle actuator latency.

```
// Actuator delay in milliseconds.
int actuatorDelay =  100;

// Actuator delay in seconds.
double delay = actuatorDelay / 1000.0;

// Initial state.
double x0 = 0;
double y0 = 0;
double psi0 = 0;
double cte0 = coeffs[0];
double epsi0 = -atan(coeffs[1]);

// State after delay.
double x_delay = x0 + (v * cos(psi0) * delay);
double y_delay = y0 + (v * sin(psi0) * delay);
double psi_delay = psi0 - (v * delta * delay / mpc.Lf);
double v_delay = v + a * delay;
double cte_delay = cte0 + (v * sin(epsi0) * delay);
double epsi_delay = epsi0 - (v * atan(coeffs[1]) * delay / mpc.Lf);

// Define the state vector.
Eigen::VectorXd state(6);
state << x_delay, y_delay, psi_delay, v_delay, cte_delay, epsi_delay;

```


## Timestep Length and Elapsed Duration (N & dt)
The number of points(N) and the time interval(dt) are chosen by trial and error. N and dt define the prediction horizon. Finally I choose N = 10 and dt = 0.01 and it works well.
